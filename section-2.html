                                On the front line of the fight for global food security, the OCP Group has naturally responded to the call of the Royal Vision for a green revolution in Africa.

                                As a world leader in phosphate and leading Moroccan player, OCP Group reflects its commitment to tangible and sustainable actions in Africa. The company helps promote the sharing of experiences, strengthen cooperation, create partnerships, and implement innovative solutions to meet the needs of sustainable transformation of African agriculture.

                                To mark this commitment and carry out its African ambitions, OCP Group set up a dedicated subsidiary in December 2015: OCP Africa. Its creation was announced at the seventh International Conference, "Argus FMB Africa Fertilizer 2016," which brought together, on 25 and 26 February in Marrakech, 400 delegates from 55 countries, including more than twenty from Africa.

                                Since then, OCP Africa has implemented a range of projects and programs to benefit African farmers by contributing to the development of integrated agricultural ecosystems.

                                OCP Africa is investing heavily and locally to create production basins by installing integrated chemical platforms in Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Ghana, which will build on locally available natural resources.

                                These industrial platforms aim to produce sufficient locally adequate fertilizers and export surpluses to other parts of the world. Another critical component of our strategy to strengthen local production is establishing blenders and storage units based on specific needs and country-specific solutions. Infrastructure projects complete this approach in several African countries, including Rwanda, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Tanzania, Senegal, and Mozambique. 
                            </p>

                                These projects will improve the accessibility of quality fertilizers, adapted to be more agile, and respond effectively to farmers' expectations. Locally-produced fertilizers will help boost fertilizer production in support of integrated chain development strategies, such as rice in Senegal, wheat in Ethiopia, or maize in Nigeria.
